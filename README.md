# -Among-Us-
Website overview 
So we have to make a website for among us, there will be two section one for imposter and one for crewmates they all will go through login process. Put 20 min timer from the time they login ed their id.
Now on the crew mates UI their will be all the tasks shown which has to be done and live dashboard that how many crew members are alive and who all are dead. Every crew mate will get 3 task separately so show only their 3 task which are allotted to them. These all things will be pre decided and remain same throughout the game.
Now on imposter UI there will be same how many alive and dead just remove the task section part.
There will be 28 task, 14 offline and 14 online, 14 online tasks will be provided by fullstacks and 14 physical tasks will be setup by altreality.
now in both the UI put emergency meeting calling option, anyone who clicks on that meeting will be called and a pop up in everyone’s interface that go to the meeting room. In meeting room there will be live voting done on paper only manually/you can do on website if you have time. One member will be ejected and if we have done voting on paper you guys will update that on website.
If ejected member is crew mate then game will resume, and if that is imposter than stop the game and pop-up option on everyone’s screen that imposter was ejected and crew mates win. And imposter do no get ejected in 20 mins pop-up that crewmates wins.
